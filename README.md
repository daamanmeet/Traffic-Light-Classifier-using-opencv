# Traffic-Light-Classifier-using-opencv
Traffic Light Classifier In this project, computer vision techniques are used to build a classifier for images of traffic lights! from a given a dataset of traffic light images in which one of three lights is illuminated: red, yellow, or green.  In this notebook, pre-process dataset images, extract features that will help us distinguish the different types of images, and use those features to classify the traffic light images into three classes: red, yellow, or green. The tasks will be broken down into a few sections:  Loading and visualizing the data. The first step in any classification task is to be familiar with your data; you'll need to load in the images of traffic lights and visualize them!  Pre-processing. The input images and output labels need to be standardized. This way, you can analyze all the input images using the same classification pipeline, and you know what output to expect when you eventually classify a new image.  Feature extraction. Next, extract some features from each image that will help distinguish and eventually classify these images.  Classification and visualizing error. Finally, you'll write one function that uses your features to classify any traffic light image. This function will take in an image and output a label.
